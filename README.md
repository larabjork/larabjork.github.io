# About Me

## From Data User to Data Analyst
I'm a former grant writer who has always been interested in how to reliably track nonprofit organizations' impact. A running theme in my grant-seeking life: longing to be able to look up the latest stats on our performance, with reports available at the click of a button.

Instead, I would often have to email a colleague (or more often, colleagues) who had many other responsibilities on top of tracking key indicators. I got used to hearing that they were in the process of updating the spreadsheet, and could they get back to me next week, and would last quarter's results be okay? Sigh.

After I wrote my final grant proposal, I started building my tech skills. When I discovered data analytics, I was home. Tools to clean up messy data? Graphs and charts that could get to the point more quickly than any paragraph? Dashboards, connected to data sources, with up-to-the-minute information? Yes, please!

I've always been a subject matter generalist, and that's put me in a good position to take the perspective of an interested but nonexpert stakeholder. Even for issues that I'm passionate about, like ending homelessness and protecting the environment, I bring that viewpoint to data visualizations and written analyses.

When I'm not deep in data, you can find me
walking in my neighborhood taking pictures, knitting yarn that I inherited from my grandmothers and great aunts, and baking bread and cookies.
